Dear Michael,

    My name is Tate Eskew.  Along with my friend Chris Davis, I run
an organization dedicated to the arts here in Nashville, TN.  We
setup shows in the area for experimental music, visual art, and
performance art.  For a while now I've been putting off building a
website for our endeavors and I've just been using social media and
email lists to provide details for the events and spaces that we
curate.  I noticed that you are indeed the owner of the fmrl.org
domain and wanted to approach you to see if you would be interested
in selling us this domain or perhaps working out an arrangement where
I could purchase the domain fmrl.io for you and your use.  I see that
you are using github to serve your site and the redirect replaces the
domain after the initial request as is.  

Would this be something that you would consider?  I didn't see any
contact information available on your site, so I figured this would
be a good way to get a missive to you.  You can contact me via
[tate@tateeskew.com](mailto:tate@tateeskew.com) if at all
interested.  I appreciate your time.

  
Best,

    Tate Eskew & Chris Davis
