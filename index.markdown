ramalloc
--------

[ramalloc][ramalloc] is a parallelized, amortized-constant time allocator for objects smaller than a hardware page. it exhibits deterministic performance characteristics, which is necessary for soft real-time applications. it also reduces memory fragmentation, which is important for long-running processes. *ramalloc* is designed for game and interpreter development but should be useful for other applications as well. *ramalloc* is also parallelized; there is no global resource that requires serialized access.

*ramalloc* source code is available under the [New BSD
License][ramalloc/license].

please read the [README][ramalloc/readme] file for details about project status and usage.
